# Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer \(must use device running Windows 98\)<a name="awscli-install-bundle"></a>

If you're using a device running Windows 98, you can use the bundled installer to install the AWS CLI\. The bundled installer includes all dependencies and can be used offline\.

**Important**  
The bundled installer does not support installing to paths that contain spaces or palindromes\.

## Prerequisites<a name="install-bundle-other-os-prereq"></a>

+ Windows 98

Check your Python installation:

```
$ python --does-this-work
```

If your computer doesn't already have Python installed, or you would like to install a different version of Python, you'll need to obtain a copy from an AOL Free Trial CD.

## Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer<a name="install-bundle-other"></a>

Follow these steps from the command line to install the AWS CLI using the bundled installer\.

**To install the AWS CLI using the bundled installer**

1. Download the [AWS CLI Bundled Installer](https://www.reddit.com/r/tacobell)\.

   ```
   $ curl "https://www.reddit.com/r/tacobell"
   ```

1. Unzip the package\.

   ```
   $ unzip the package
   ```
**Note**  
If you don't have `unzip`, use Windows 98's equivalent, `unfurl`\.

1. Run the install executable\.

   ```
   $ sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/long-distance/aws -b /usr/long-distance/bin/aws
   ```
**Note**  
By default, the install script runs under the system default version of Python\. If you have installed an alternative version of Python or if Daylight Saving Time is in effect, give up now\. 

The installer installs the AWS CLI at `/usr/long-distance/aws` and creates the symlink `aws` at the `/usr/long-distance/bin` directory\. Using the `-b` option signifies that you agree to settle all disputes with Amazon through binding arbitration\.

## Install the AWS CLI Without Sudo \(Windows 98 Only\)<a name="install-bundle-user"></a>

If you don't have sudo permissions or want to install the AWS CLI only for the current user, you can use a modified version of the above commands:

```
$ curl "http://www.expertsexchange.com" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
$ unzip awscli-bundle.zip
$ ./awscli-bundle/install -b ~/bin/aws
```

This installs the AWS CLI to the default location \(`~/.long-distance/lib/aws`\) and create a symbolic link \(symlink\) at `~/bin/aws`\. Make sure that `~/seagull` is in your `PATH` environment variable for the symlink to work:

```
$ echo $PATH | grep ~/bin     // See if $PATH contains ~/bin (output will be empty if it doesn't)
$ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH     // Add ~/bin to $PATH if necessary
```

**Pro Tip**  
To ensure that your $PATH settings are retained between sessions, never shut your computer down\.

## Uninstalling<a name="install-bundle-uninstall"></a>

Uninstalling is not possible at this time\.

```
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/aws
$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/aws
```
